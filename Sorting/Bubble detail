Take example 1 3 2 
so if we did j < n-1 without flag and a[j]>a[j+1]
i th loop 0 to 2
j th loop 0 to 2
dry run i  j j+1 swap 
        0  0  1  1>3 no swap
        0  1  2  3>2 swap 1 2 3
        0  2  -   -    -
        1  0  1  1>2 no swap 
        1  1  2  2>3 no swap
        1  2  -  -     -
        2  0  1  1>2 no swap
        2  1  2  2>3 no swap 
        2  2  -   -    - 
so here we notice there are unnecessary loops plus if the array is already arranged there no need to swap so for that reason we give flag .
n-1-i is to reduce useless step last or first element gets sorted so no need of extra steps .
